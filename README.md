Originally made by Jefferson Smith for Blender 2.78, updated by Anime Nyan for Blender 2.93+.

A render-time add-on for Blender that eliminates time and resources wasted on producing redundant frames. It does this by detecting frames that will be identical to one already rendered and reusing that instead of rendering it again.
